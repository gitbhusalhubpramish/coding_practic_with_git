## Installation
To install Python, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

To verify the installation, open your terminal (or command prompt) and type:
```sh
python --version
```
## Syntax and Basics
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Here's a simple example:

```python

print("Hello, World!")
```
### Comments
Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the interpreter:

```python
Copy code
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment
```
### Variables
Variables are used to store data:

```python
Copy code
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)
```
## Data Types
Python has several built-in data types:

- **Numbers**: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- **Strings**: `str`
- **Booleans**: `bool`
- **Lists**: `list`
- **Tuples**: `tuple`
- **Dictionaries**: `dict`
- **Sets**: `set`
### Examples:
```python
# Numbers
x = 10       # int
y = 3.14     # float
z = 1 + 2j   # complex

# Strings
name = "Alice"

# Booleans
is_active = True

# Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Tuples
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionaries
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

# Sets
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}
```
## Control Structures
Control structures allow you to control the flow of your program.

### Conditional Statements
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```
### Loops
**For Loop**
```python
for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]:
    print(fruit)
```
**While Loop**
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
## Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

```python

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```
### Built-in Functions
Python provides many built-in functions like print(), len(), type(), etc.

```python
Copy code
print(len("Hello, World!"))  # Output: 13
print(type(10))              # Output: <class 'int'>
```
## Common Libraries
Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries for various tasks. Some commonly used libraries include:

- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization
- **Requests**: HTTP requests
- **Flask/Django**: Web development
### Example: Using NumPy
```python
Copy code
import numpy as np

array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(array)
```
