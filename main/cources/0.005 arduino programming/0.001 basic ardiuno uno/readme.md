## What is Arduino Uno?
Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It is widely used in electronics projects due to its simplicity, versatility, and ease of use.

### Features
- Microcontroller: ATmega328P
- Operating Voltage: 5V
- Input Voltage (recommended): 7-12V
- Digital I/O Pins: 14 (6 provide PWM output)
- Analog Input Pins: 6
- Clock Speed: 16 MHz

## Arduino Uno Pinout

### Key Components
1. **Digital Pins**: Used for input or output. Pins 0-13.
2. **Analog Pins**: Used to read analog signals. Pins A0-A5.
3. **Power Pins**: Includes 5V, 3.3V, GND, and VIN.
4. **Reset Button**: Resets the microcontroller.
5. **USB Port**: Used for programming and power supply.
6. **Power Jack**: Alternative power supply using a DC adapter.

### Pin Diagram
Refer to the official Arduino Uno pinout diagram for detailed labeling.

## Getting Started with Arduino Uno

### Step 1: Install Arduino IDE
1. Download the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Install the IDE on your computer.

### Step 2: Connect the Arduino Uno
1. Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the correct board and port in the "Tools" menu.

### Step 3: Upload Your First Program
1. Open the **Blink** example from the IDE: `File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink`.
2. Click the **Upload** button.
3. Observe the onboard LED blinking.

### Blink Example Code
```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // Initialize the LED pin as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // Turn the LED on
  delay(1000);                     // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  // Turn the LED off
  delay(1000);                     // Wait for 1 second
}
```

## Additional Tips
- **Debugging**: Use `Serial.begin()` and `Serial.println()` for debugging.
- **Libraries**: Explore libraries to extend functionality (e.g., servo motors, sensors).
- **Community**: Join the Arduino forums and communities for support.
