# Coding Practice with Git

## Some Rules You Should Follow

### Markdown (.md) Files
If there is a `.md` file, first forget all other files and visit the `.md` file. It is usually named `README.md` or `readme.md`. Never open a markdown file in the editor; instead, open it in preview mode. When opening a markdown file in most IDEs, you will have the option to preview the file. Open it in preview mode.

### Exercises and Solutions
After teaching you about a topic, I will give you some exercises. If you solve them, I will continue with that programming language. When you solve the exercise, I will rate your solution and solve that problem in my own way. Until you solve the exercise of one programming language, I will start a new language or add files in other languages. Once you solve your exercise, you must put the solved exercise file in the same folder where I gave you the exercise. Your main file name must be `main`. You also need to create a new folder in that folder where I gave you the exercise, and name that folder `{yourname/user id} solution`, replacing `{yourname/user id}` with your name or your GitHub ID.Here are some rules for exercise:
- **AI**: You can't use AI. If you use then you have to solve again.
- **Help**: You can't ask help to any one if you have any confusion ask me in Discussion in github
- **Error, Accuraty and Efficiency**There must be 0 error
- **Explanation**: Tell every things like why did you use this function in comment(`//`) or you can make a markdown  file to define it.

### Unnecessary Changes; Deleting Important Files, Changing Filenames, Changing Definitions, etc.
If you make any unnecessary changes, such as deleting important files, changing filenames, changing definitions, etc., you will be removed from this repository.

## Visiting Files
There are some package files which are important but do not need to be read. Files like `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, etc., do not need your attention. Instead, visit the `source` folder and learn in the following order: first web development, then C++, then Python, and so on. Read serially. If there is a folder whose sub-folder names start with this pattern: `0.001 {main content}`, `0.002 {main content}`, etc., visit `0.001 {main content}` first, then `0.002 {main content}`, and so on.

## Installing Software, Packages
I recommend you use VS Code as an IDE. Other necessary installations include MinGW, Node.js, Python, and pip.
