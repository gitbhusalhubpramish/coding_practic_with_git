# Introduction to C++

## Overview

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It offers a combination of both high-level and low-level language features, making it a versatile and powerful language suitable for a wide range of applications.

## History

- **1979**: Bjarne Stroustrup begins work on "C with Classes," the precursor to C++.
- **1983**: The name "C++" is adopted.
- **1985**: The first edition of "The C++ Programming Language" is published.
- **1998**: The ISO standard for C++ (C++98) is released.
- **2011**: Major update with C++11, introducing new features and improvements.
- **2014**: Further updates with C++14.
- **2017**: Continued enhancements with C++17.
- **2020**: Latest standard, C++20, introduces significant new features.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Provides a set of common data structures and algorithms.
- **Memory Management**: Offers manual memory management with pointers and dynamic allocation.
- **Performance**: Close-to-hardware performance, making it suitable for system/software development.
- **Portability**: Code can be compiled and run on many different platforms with little to no modification.
- **Rich Functionality**: Includes support for both procedural and functional programming paradigms.

## Basic Syntax

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
